By loading and parsing OpenAPI specification files from the knowledgebase directory, it builds a comprehensive understanding of available APIs, their capabilities, endpoints, and base URLs. When given a user query, the selector agent evaluates the query against all available API specifications and provides a reasoned recommendation for which API and specific endpoint is most appropriate, including the correct sandbox base URL to use. This intelligent routing capability enables the main warehouse agent to dynamically work with multiple SAP APIs without hardcoded API selections, making the system more flexible and maintainable as new APIs are added to the knowledgebase."
